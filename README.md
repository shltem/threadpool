# threadpool
This repository contains an implementation of the Thread Pool pattern in Java. The Thread Pool is a concurrent pattern that provides a way to manage a pool of threads that can be used to execute tasks concurrently.<br> 
The pattern allows you to reuse threads to execute a large number of tasks, without incurring the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each task.
